these tests are used to test the node images

setup
1) install linqpad
2) add lprun to PATH
3) install diff (cygwin)
4) create private stamp
5) push new node image to private stamp

gotcha
- remember to update stamp name
- remember to update image tag 
- remember to change test repo
- remember to update expected results


to run
1) nodeTest.bat
2) the test passes if the diff is empty
